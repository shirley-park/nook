# Wellbeing

So, it’s the final project. How might I manage my wellbeing during the next week and a bit?

### How are we feeling?

- I’m feeling good but very conscious of the need to keep my motivation levels up for this larger project.
- The plan for the next week and a bit will be to: have a decent sleep each night, eat well and stay hydrated.
- Throughout the day, I will be using a Pomodoro timer to stay on task (50 minutes focus time, 10 minutes break) and a 90 minute lunch break from 12:30pm.

### Setting expectations

- I plan to head into the campus to work on the project, keeping to the similar 9-5pm hours, and work on one full day in the weekend.

### Decision making

- When I’m undecided on something I plan to chat with either a classmate or facilitator to get different perspectives before making the final decision.

### Setting expectations

- I plan to head into the campus to work on the project, keeping to the similar 9-5pm hours

### Seeking technical and non-technical help

- For technical things, I will set a limit of 15 minutes for how much time I will try to sort out the problem myself and if I surpass 15 minutes, I will reach out to a facilitator.
- If I need a non-technical chin wag, I’ll probably be reaching out to classmates from the cohort.

### My rituals and how I will work

- Every morning I will have a quick check-in with my facilitator via Slack
- To keep myself accountable, I will have daily stand-ups/calls with a facilitator around 2pm each day to give updates on
    - my progress
    - anything I am stuck on
    - my tasks for the remainder of the day


### Survival plan

- Every morning I will be practising mindfulness, and yoga on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
- I will take breaks from the computer screen during the day, and go out for coffee or lunch or take a walk in the domain. Most evenings I’ll be spending some time with my family.
